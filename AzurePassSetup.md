Verify you can sign into the Azure portal at https://portal.azure.com

## Background information
This Azure pass provides restricted access to Azure services for a limited time. Students must activate their Azure pass subscription using a Microsoft account (such as an outlook.com, live.com, or hotmail.com address) â€“ if they don't already have a Microsoft account, they can sign up for one at https://live.com.

It is recommended that students do not associate a corporate or school account with an Azure pass subscription. Additionally, we encourage students to use a fresh Azure Pass subscription in preference to their own personal, work, or school Azure subscription. Some resources used in this course are subject to quota restrictions, which may limit students' ability to complete the labs successfully.

If students have an existing Azure subscription, they may find that credential caching prevents them logging in with the credentials associated with their Azure Pass subscription. In this scenario, encourage students to try using an InPrivate/Incognito browser session.
